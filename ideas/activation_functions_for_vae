In a variation autoencoder (VAE), which is a type of generative model used for unsupervised learning, there are
specific activation functions typically used for different parts of the network.

Encoder Activation Function:
The encoder in a VAE is responsible for mapping the input data into the latent space. Since the encoder's output is
used to parameterize the probability distribution of the latent variables (usually Gaussian), it is common to use
linear activation for the encoder's output layer. This means the encoder does not have an activation function, and the
output values are directly used as the mean and variance parameters for the latent distribution.

Decoder Activation Function:
The decoder in a VAE takes samples from the latent space and reconstructs the original data from these samples.
The decoder output is usually designed to match the data distribution. Depending on the type of data you are working
with, you might use different activation functions for the decoder:

Binary Data (e.g., images with binary pixel values):
In this case, you can use the sigmoid activation function in the decoder's output layer. The sigmoid function will
squish the values between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary data reconstruction.

Continuous Data (e.g., images with pixel values in the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1]):
For continuous data, you can use the appropriate activation function based on the data scaling. For instance, if
your pixel values are in the range [0, 1], you can use the sigmoid activation function again to obtain values within
that range. If your data is scaled to [-1, 1], you can use the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function.

Remember that the activation functions play a crucial role in the VAE's reconstruction ability, and they should be
chosen carefully based on the characteristics of your data.

In summary, for a VAE, the encoder typically uses no activation function (linear), while the decoder's activation
function depends on the nature of the data being reconstructed (sigmoid for binary data and sigmoid/tanh for continuous
data).
