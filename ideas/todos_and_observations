TODO:
1. raise samplerate
2. modify latent space dims
3. modify the architecture
4. train more (google colab)
5. experiment with more activation/normalization combos
6. use sigma as a hyperparameter (reconstruction_loss_weight)
7. experiment with a LR scheduler
8. train on both raw audio and spectrograms
9. post-processing smoothing to fill in the gaps
10. add tensorboard scalars


OBSERVATIONS:
1. modifying the LS dims actually shapes the waveform
2. modifying the LS dims actually shapes the waveform from 5 to 10, adds more lowend
