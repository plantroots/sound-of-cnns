Encountering loss values of NaN (Not a Number) during training in TensorFlow typically indicates numerical instability
or other issues in the optimization process. Here are some common causes for loss becoming NaN during training:

1. **Learning Rate Too High**: A learning rate that is too high can cause the optimization process to diverge, leading
to NaN values in the loss. Try reducing the learning rate to a smaller value and see if the issue persists.

2. **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**: In deep networks, gradients can become very small (vanishing) or very large
(exploding), causing instability during optimization. This can lead to NaN values in the loss. Consider using
techniques like gradient clipping or batch normalization to address this issue.

3. **Improper Data Preprocessing**: Incorrect data preprocessing, such as normalization, can lead to numerical
instabilities during training. Ensure that you preprocess your data correctly and consistently.

4. **Invalid Loss Function**: Using an inappropriate or unstable loss function can cause NaN values. Double-check the
formulation and implementation of your loss function.

5. **Numerical Precision**: In some cases, numerical precision issues can arise due to the limited representation of
floating-point numbers. This can lead to small values getting rounded to zero or causing other numerical instabilities.

6. **NaN or Infinite Input Data**: If your input data contains NaN or infinite values, it can propagate through the
network and lead to NaN loss values. Ensure that your input data is properly cleaned and does not contain any invalid values.

7. **Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and memorizes the training data, leading
to poor generalization. This can result in unstable training and potentially NaN loss values. Consider using regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting.

8. **Missing Data**: If your data contains missing values, ensure you handle them properly. Some operations in
TensorFlow might not handle NaN values correctly, leading to NaN in the loss.

9. **Incorrect Model Architecture**: A poorly designed model architecture might not be able to learn from the data
properly and lead to numerical issues. Check if your model is suitable for the task at hand and has enough capacity to
learn the patterns in the data.

10. **Numerical Instabilities in Custom Operations**: If you are using custom operations or loss functions, check
for numerical instabilities in those implementations.

To diagnose and fix the issue, you can try the following steps:

- Set the learning rate to a small value.
- Check your loss function and ensure its stability.
- Print intermediate values during training using `tf.print()` to identify where NaN values are introduced.
- Check the data preprocessing and ensure it is done correctly.
- Ensure that your input data does not contain NaN or infinite values.
- Consider reducing the complexity of your model or using regularization techniques.
- If using custom operations, thoroughly check their implementations for numerical stability.

By carefully inspecting these potential causes, you can address the issue of NaN loss during training and achieve more
stable and successful model training.
