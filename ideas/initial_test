1. Train on 10 drum samples with spectrograms.
2. Pick 4 training samples and see how the model reconstructs them.
3. Implement a basic latent space sampling method and see if it really is different from the original 10 samples.
4. Try to visualize the latent space to see is there is clustering around the origin.
