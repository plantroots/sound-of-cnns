1. Train on 10 drum samples with spectrograms.
2. Pick 4 training samples and see how the model reconstructs them.
3. Implement a basic latent space sampling method and see if it really is different from the original 10 samples.
(can I reconstruct the signal starting from the spectrogram using only the mean of the min/max values?)
4. Try to visualize the latent space to see is there is clustering around the origin.
